# Gird-Traversing-Robot-Code
It is for a project " Gird Traversing Robot based on Travelling Salesman Problem".A fully autonomous robot is built to traverse a grid and pick up objects from various node points in the grid and carry those to the goal point. A object avoidance algorithm is used. So, that there will not be any collision with obstacles at the nodes.
